# AGENTS.md

SourceryKit is the Python SDK for [Provably](https://provably.ai): verifiable guardrails
for AI agents — it records outbound HTTP calls, enforces endpoint policies, and checks an
agent's claims against what those calls actually returned, so a hallucinated value is
**caught** instead of shipped.

**Start with a cookbook below and copy it** — the cookbooks are the ground truth for a
correct integration. Everything after is reference; load only what a task needs.

> [!WARNING]
> One-time setup has a single human-only step (an email verification click) — everything
> else is agent-drivable. Details: [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md).

## Cookbooks (runnable examples — copy these)

Same weather-verify flow in three frameworks. Each fetches the London temperature from
open-meteo, returns its claims as `SourceryKitAgentResponse` (never computed by hand), and
runs the full intercept → `build_handoff_payload` → `evaluate_handoff` loop. Run
`python agent_run.py` for a `PASS`; add `--tamper` to fake a value and watch it get `CAUGHT`.

| Cookbook | Framework | What you'll find |
|---|---|---|
| [openai_agents](cookbooks/openai_agents) | OpenAI Agents SDK | Structured output via `output_type=SourceryKitAgentResponse` |
| [claude_agent](cookbooks/claude_agent) | Claude Agent SDK | Structured output via `output_format` json_schema |
| [langchain_agent](cookbooks/langchain_agent) | LangChain `create_agent` | Structured output via `response_format=`, claims read from `result["structured_response"]` |

## The flow at a glance

```
bootstrap_system()              # init: schema, handshake, HTTP interceptor — call first, once
insert_trusted_endpoint(url)    # allow-list each outbound endpoint
async_intercept_context(...)    # wrap the tool's HTTP call — records it
SourceryKitAgentResponse        # the agent's structured output (reasoning + claimed_values)
build_handoff_payload(...)      # compile claims; intercept_agent_id must match the agent_id above
evaluate_handoff(payload)       # -> {"outcome": "PASS" | "CAUGHT" | "ERROR", "per_claim": [...]}
```

Outcomes:

- `PASS` — every claim matched the recorded data.
- `CAUGHT` — a claim did not match the recorded data, or its endpoint was not trusted.
- `ERROR` — nothing was verified (for example, zero claims could be resolved). Verifying
  zero claims is always `ERROR`, never a pass.

Async throughout — `await` every SDK call. Recorded traffic: `httpx`, `aiohttp`, and
`requests`. `action_name` is the join key between the intercepted call and the claim — it
must match.
